Prediction of Functional Lysine (K) Crotonylation (pFKcr) Sites
We developed a novel protein language model (PLM)-based framework called "prediction of Functional Kcr sites" (pFKhib). This framework captures intricate patterns in protein sequences, enabling more accurate and efficient predictions of functional Kcr sites. In this study, we defined the crotonylation site peptide (CSP) as a crotonylation residue with m residues upstream and n residues downstream, using CSP (10, 10) for training. First, we trained a pre-trained model, pFKcr-pre. The CSP (10, 10) peptide was encoded into 11 types of 1D feature vectors, with each vector associated with a specific deep neural network (DNN) model to predict a score. This approach generated 11 scores for each Kcr site. We then employed an integrated DNN to combine these scores into a final prediction score. Finally, we fine-tuned the pFKcr-pre model through few-shot transfer learning to develop the pFKcr model, which predicts the functionality of Kcr sites.
